# Landing-Page

This is a flexbox practice project. I will be creating a generic landing page and retrofitting it into a landing page for a music artist's website.

This page has been especially helpful in customizing sections of the page with flexbox. I started off creating the header and its contents then went to sizing each section to my preferred perameters. finishing with the footer layout which was easy enough as it was intended to remain static.

I then used flexbox on the header and each section to keep the layout relatively the same as the screen resizes. After i got the layout to my liking I added some hover and active responses out of some elements and added relative links to the menu text.

The asthetic was important to me as I wanted the layout to remain minimal but effective and eye-catching for the artist's fans. I added a media query and changed quite a few properties @ 700px to keep the layout clean and keep it from squeezing together unattractively. The line-spacing, font-weight and letter-spacing helped achieve the modern and clean asthetic in this page.

Eventually, I decided to add custom links to the artist's work through the main page hyperlinks and via clicking on album artwork in the "listen" section.

With the artist's permission I want to enable the sign-up options and link it to an outside page or possibly enable a pop-up through js to attain fan information such as name age location and email for newsletter and demographic data pooling purposes.

The original layout and color scheme was influenced by The Odin Project's "landing page" assignment.
